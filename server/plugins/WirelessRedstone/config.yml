# This is the Wireless Redstone main configuration file.
# 
#        !Configuration explained!
# ConfigVersion            Do NOT change this value.
# Language                 Corresponds to the language used by the plugin.
# ColourfulLogging         Set this value to true if you want the log in the console to be written with colors (it's easier to see what's wrong).
# CheckForUpdates          If you don't want to be spammed with a message telling you that an amazing new release with new great functionalities has been released, then set it to false.
# Metrics                  Enable metrics.
# Sentry                   Enable Sentry services. This service automatically sends exceptions to a central server to quickly investigate problems.
# SilentMode               The plugin doesn't send any feedback if you don't have permissions to a certain command.
# DebugMode                Don't activate it if you're not a tester or a developer.
# DropSignWhenBroken       This value can be set to false because some people can create signs with a command and destroy them to get free signs.
# InteractTransmitterTime  The time in milliseconds you activate a transmitter if you interact with it.
# CacheRefreshFrequency    Cache refresh time in seconds, it's recommended to leave this value as it is. Max value is 480 and min value is 60.
# gateLogic                The logic of the transmitters (more info can be found on the Minecraft redstone circuit wiki), available options: OR, IGNORE (IGNORE = logic from version <2.0).
# saveOption               Save the channels in YML or SQLITE. MYSQL isn't supported yet.
